# Netlink
## A Decentralized, Real-Time Communication Ecosystem
Open, federated, and performance-optimized for modern communications.

Netlink is a cutting-edge platform designed for real-time interactions that blend performance, privacy, and extensibility. It tackles the limitations of legacy messaging systems by embracing federation, modular architecture, and open participation.

## Netlink’s mission is to build a future-proof communications network that is:

 - Federated: independent nodes communicate seamlessly across a common ecosystem.

 - Privacy-centric: minimal data collection with transparent handling.

 - High-performance: low latency and real-time data flows.

 - Open source and auditable: code and processes under community scrutiny.

Netlink moves beyond centralized platforms toward a community-owned infrastructure capable of scaling from small groups to global deployments.
